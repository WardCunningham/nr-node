Node Package to Report via NewRelic Platform API


We're experimenting with measurement devices
hosted on a Raspberry Pi. We're using Node.js
to configure and collect information. We'll
use this package to report measurements
through the NewRelic Platform API. [website](http://newrelic.com/platform)
